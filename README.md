# HousingPricePrediction

## Introduction
If we were to ask a home buyer to explain their dream house, they would probably not begin with the height of the garage ceiling or the proximity to a highway. The questions that really concern home buyers are which the determinants of housing prices are. Would it be possible to explain the price of a house by considering only some particular features like e.g. the neighbourhood of the house?

Good, there are data scientists like us to solve such questions and, even better, provide a model that predicts housing prices!

So brace yourself, pour a big glass of beer and enjoy our predictive analysis of housing prices in Ames!
